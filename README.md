I’m a passionate and data-driven AI & Product Professional specializing in LLM-based agentic AI solutions, data observability, and intelligent platform design.
I’m particularly focused on:
Designing & architecting agentic AI systems that leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, and hybrid LLM workflows.
Data & AI observability, ensuring systems are transparent, performant, trustworthy, and aligned with enterprise observability standards.
Building collaborative platforms where data insights and AI capabilities drive measurable impact.
Bridging technical execution and strategic product vision, with a keen emphasis on data quality, model reliability, and human-centric outcomes.

What I work on

AI Agents: single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, browser agents, voice agents, local agents
Ready-to-run examples: clone → install → run
Dev workflows: how to structure agents, handle tools, logs, eval, planning
RAG setups: simple chains → agentic RAG → hybrid search → local RAG
Chat-with-anything apps: GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, videos, research papers
Fine-tuning: Gemma, Llama, and other OSS models
Full code-first crash course on Agent Development Kit and OpenAI SDK
